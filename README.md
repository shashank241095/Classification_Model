# Classification_Model
Gaussian Naive Byes model to Classify Spam 




Model Used:- GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES to perform Classification
Dataset Used:- Spambase http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase



Steps Perfromed Below:

1) Data read.
2) Divided into K sets and used one set for testing and other all for Training.
3) Split Train Data by class inside dictionary
4) Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation for each class and each attribute
5) Take the test input one by one and calculate Gaussian Probability to predict the Weightage of each class
6) Find False Positive and False negative with error rates 
7) Use Pandas to display table
8) (optional) Display Accuracy of the model
